The modification panel is available via a button at the bottom of the mission briefing screen. 
On the panel you can freely move countries around as you see fit.

"OK" Executes the changes, if any. 

Press "Esc" will close the modification window, and change nothing.

Once anything is changed, save the mission after clicking 'OK'.
